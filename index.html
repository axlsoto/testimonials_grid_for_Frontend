                <p>I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the
                    company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny´s worth.</p>

                <p>"I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I´ve been looking to make a transition and
                    have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and
                    found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most
                    gruelling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I´ve successfully switched careers,
                    working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. "</p>

                    junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you from an

            <div class="testimony">
                <p>"Before joining the bootcamp, I´ve never whitten a line of code. I needed some structure from
                    profressionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a
                    former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum
                    and staff did not disapoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance.
                    The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a
                    way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I´ve ofter referred to it during interviews as an
                    example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer
                    after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommended! "</p>
